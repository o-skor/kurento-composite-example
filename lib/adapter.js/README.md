[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/webrtc/adapter.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/webrtc/adapter)

# WebRTC adapter #
[adapter.js] is a shim to insulate apps from spec changes and prefix differences. In fact, the standards and protocols used for WebRTC implementations are highly stable, and there are only a few prefixed names. For full interop information, see [webrtc.org/web-apis/interop](http://www.webrtc.org/web-apis/interop).

## Install ##
#### Bower
```bash
bower install webrtc-adapter
```
#### Inclusion on Browser

<script src="bower_components/webrtc-adapter/adapter.js"></script>
```
